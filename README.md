### Huge thanks to everyone at Aniyomi for making a great open source app!
This repository is a more lightweight version of Aniyomi used for loading only the Aniyomi extensions in CloudStream.
Small modifications are made to convert Aniyomi classes to Cloudstream classes, but they are easily removable if anyone wants to fork this.
